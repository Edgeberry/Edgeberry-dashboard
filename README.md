The device registry is a centralized database that stores information about the IoT devices. It keeps track of device details like connectivity status, device attributes, ...

Fleet indexing is enabled to organize and search for IoT devices efficiently. It creates a searchable index of your devices based on their attributes. This makes it easier to find and manage devices at scale.
